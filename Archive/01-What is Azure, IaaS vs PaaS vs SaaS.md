## On-Premise Data Center
An on-premise data center is a physical infrastructure that is owned, managed, and operated by an organization within its own premises. It consists of servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and other necessary hardware and software components.

## Virtual Machines
A VM is a virtualized instance of a computer that can perform almost all of the same functions as a computer, including running applications and operating systems.

## Challenges with On-Premise Data Center
### CapEx
- Huge Upfront Cost.
- Time & Efforts
### Maintenance Cost
- Huge upkeep cost
- Need to have trained IT Staff
### Limited Scalability
- Upscaling is difficult
- Wastage of resources and money
### Less accessibility
- Distributed workforce is tricky
### Industry compliance
- Difficult to implement and comply with regulations
- Challenges for industry such as Finance or Healthcare
#### Environmental Issues
- A major set back to environment
### Many more
- And yet many more

> So here cloud technology comes as rescue.

Cloud technology is like all the hardwares and software components are hosted on someone else data centers like Microsft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, servers, networking, databases, software, analytics, and intelligence. It allows users to rent IT services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis,instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers.

Cloud computing is when instead of using your own data centers you use computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software over the internet. You don't own all these resources, but you just pay to the extent you use them.

> And this kind of expenditure is known as Operational cost.

> Pay as you go

## Disadvantages of using Cloud
-  Depends on Internet Connection
- Privacy & Compliance
(Your data is no longer on your physical storage but on cloud area of concern on certain type of application)
- Security
(Because its shared responsibility it confuses many users and this leads in security breaches some times.)
